I am a passionate Machine Learning Engineer applying research to products. I like reasoning about systems, thinking through problems and applying technology with intent to create tooling where none exists. I hold multiple engineering degrees with experience in diverse fields including Bio-medical Research, Sensor Design and Manufacture, Robotics, Automation, Cloud Software and Document Processing.

**At Work**

I have served as a visionary and developer of first party software, ML and AI solutions at early and growth stage companies, spearheading many efforts related to ML including R&D, data-science and engineering. I have identified and defined problems fit for machine learning, translated state-of-the-art research to production systems, and deployed scalable closed loop ML solutions to solve complex real-world challenges. I have experience across domains including robotics, computer vision, natural language processing and document understanding. I have presented on vision, R&D, technology and roadmaps to diverse audiences.

Day to day, I foster a friendly work atmosphere that promotes passionate, curious engagement around challenging problems. I champion the pragmatic use of agile process, the appropriate introduction of automation, and the application of a product mindset.
