I am a passionate Machine Learning Engineer applying research to products. I am most effective conducting pragmatic research and building prototypes of future thinking technologies. I enjoy reasoning about systems, thinking through problems and applying technology with intent to create tooling where none exists. I hold multiple engineering degrees with experience in diverse fields including Bio-medical Research, Sensor Design and Manufacture, Robotics, Automation, Cloud Software and Document Processing.

**At Work**

I have served as a visionary IC, research engineer and developer of first party software, ML and AI solutions at early and growth stage companies, spearheading many efforts related to ML including R&D, datascience and engineering.

Day to day, I foster a friendly work atmosphere that promotes passionate, curious engagement around challenging problems. I champion the pragmatic use of agile process, the appropriate introduction of automation, and the application of a product mindset.

With a focus on Deep Learning, I have identified and defined problems fit for ML, translated state-of-the-art research to production systems, and deployed scalable closed loop ML solutions to solve complex real-world challenges.

I bring a wealth of hands-on experience applying deep learning to robotics, computer vision, image processing, NLP and document understanding. I have also presented on vision, R&D, technology and roadmaps to diverse audiences.

**At Play**

My passion projects combine data driven design, art and engineering.

I love generative AI, interactive 3D graphics and rapid physical prototyping.

You can usually find me playing music, mountain biking or adventuring outdoors.
